# Promotional-Insights-of-a-Retail-Chain
Problem Statement:
AtliQ Mart is a retail giant with 50 supermarkets in the 10 cities of India. During Festive time, all the stores ran promotional offers like “Buy 1 Get 1 Free”, Discounts (25% OFF, 33% OFF, 50% OFF”), “500Rs. Cashback” on their branded products. We are tasked to analyze the impact of all these promotions on sales and revenue.

Key Performance Indicators:

a. #Incremental Revenue (I.R): Difference in Revenue after promotions and before promotions                                    

b. Incremental Sold Units: Difference in number of units sold after promotions and before promotions

Tools Used: Tableau

Insights:

a. Management should replicate strategies from top stores in Bengaluru, Chennai, Mysuru to other low performing cities.

b. Increase marketing efforts and resources towards BOGOF promotions as they have good balance between IR and ISU.

c. Consider reviewing or discontinuing the discount promotions to improve the Incremental Revenue by 3% and Incremental Sold Units by 2% .
